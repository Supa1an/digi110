                <p>Everyone always has a side that leaves regrets, and most of my regrets are left in my home. This is one of the things that has always bothered me. I am the only child in my family with only my father and mother. On the day I just turned 16, I came to Canada alone for a 9-year study abroad program. Every year, I chose to go back to my family for a month during the summer to spend time with them. But with the distance and communication barrier, I didn't understand my parents well, and they had a hard time understanding me. In China, family is actually a very important existence, and I have been separated from it for half of my upbringing.
                </p>
                <p>Since I was a child, my family didn't really bring me much companionship because my mom and dad both had very heavy workloads. My mom was also always like my leader and teacher handing out tasks to me, giving me advice as well as correcting my direction when I made mistakes. Probably because we had been away from each other for a long time, we could only contact each other through video calls or messages, and there was a feeling of familiarity and strangeness between us.
                </p>
                <p>Most of the time in my life back home, I played the role of a full-time housewife. I didn't need to think about work or study during the holidays. Because I was abroad for too long, I didn't have a lot of friends back home to get together with. My day-to-day life is to act as my mother's driver or secretary during the day, assisting her with her work. And at night I became the family chef. I like to cook for my family the dishes I learned from various places, and I feel very happy.
