            I feel it is important to be actively involved in extracurricular activities at school. I love the gym at VIU, I was a basketball player until I was in high school, and then it was hard to play as an athlete due to a knee injury. But basketball has always been my favourite sport, so you can often see me playing in the school gym during Open Gym hours.

                <p>Unlike many students who like to immerse themselves in the library to study. If no group work requires a meeting to communicate. Most of the time I will do my own study at home. I feel that being in my own study room allows me to study more efficiently. It may also be that I need my own familiar environment and my own familiar equipment. I've got great equipment in my study for studying and working, and it has helped me to work and study more efficiently.</p>

                <p>When it comes to home study, I have to mention the COVID-19 period. For some reason, I had to return to China to study online. 15 hours of time difference made me start my classes from 12 am to 8:30 am daily. I had to change the way I studied because I was feeling depressed after a month of being locked in my study room all night. So I turned my dining room table into my workstation to have some sunflowers or other plants on the table to add some vitality in a more open area.</p>

            <td> 
                <p>As an international student, I started my studies in Canada at a high school called Ballenas, located in Parksville, a small city in the middle of Vancouver Island, and at first, I was a little uncomfortable coming from a big city to a small place, but then Parksville changed my attitude and even changed me. I started to love Vancouver Island and enjoy nature-related activities. This is a sign that I will become a traveller in the real sense.
