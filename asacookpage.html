    <h1>You should be a Foody to be a Cook</h1>
    <div class="intro">
    <p>As the pace of people's lives accelerates and the rise of various food delivery services, cooking seems to have become a boring and luxurious thing to do. Many times people don't even want to cook because they don't want to do the dishes. But for me, cooking is a joy. I think cooking is not only a skill but also an art. It is the art of combining raw vegetables and meat with various seasonings to produce a unique dish according to your mood and ideas. I enjoy the process of cooking and also enjoy watching people around me eat the food I make. Everyone who loves to cook is a true food lover. I will make my own changes to different countries' food according to my own ideas, like making Japanese food with Indian-style seasoning sometimes brings unexpected effects.
